<p>Socio-psychological elements including moral and reasonable factors to consider were found to the drivers in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease event and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that an absence of certified IPM specialists and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM implementation in developed nations.</p>
<p>Todays experts utilize Integrated Pest Management strategies which include traps and exclusion techniques to control pests. 2Standard Covered Pests consist of cockroaches, mice, rats, silverfish, "house" ants (excluding carpenter ants, fire ants, pharaoh ants & tawny insane ants), clothes moths, non-poisonous spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, earwigs, house crickets and paper wasps.</p>
