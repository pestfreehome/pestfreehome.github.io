<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the environment as a whole and takes into account a balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>When pest problems are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control procedures are needed. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry contaminants in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>
