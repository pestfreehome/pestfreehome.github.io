<p>In Asia, numerous phases of IPM have been effectively adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>Recent studies document the requirement for continued reductions in hazardous pesticide usage and practices. Although the standard elements of IPM are always the very same, the specific elements of an IPM program differ from one environment or situation to another. When done prior to spacing the plants, application of predatory termites against thrips in potted plants is more effective.</p>
<p>The Georgia Pest Management Handbook gives present info on choice, application, and safe use of pest control chemicals. New clients conserve 10% off preliminary pest control services or conserve $50 off termite treatments. It is essential that we develop a more active approach that seeks to understand natural opponents and how they function as a part of the environment and to promote their effectiveness by use of environment management (landscape ecology) and other cultural management approaches.</p>
