Flexibility and Time- The process of pest control takes time and efforts. Pests are unwanted plants, animals, insects, germs or other organisms that interfere with human activity.</p>
<p>The success of control tactics need to be determined using signs based upon tracking of harmful organisms, beneficials, pesticide usage, and impact on the environment. These consist of the revival of pest populations after decimation of the natural opponents, development of insecticide-resistant populations, and negative impacts on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>

What is thought about an excellent IPM program today may be considered a chemical intensive program in a couple of years. Use proper crop rotation practices and target pests with multiple modes of action to make it harder for pests to adjust.</p>
