<p>A common mistake most organisations encounter is explaining their business name too actually by using tired pest control terms like control, insecticide, pesticide, and management. The pest management market is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and roughly 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, insects, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, flies and bees are typically found pests in our society.</p>
