<p>The 4 significant issues experienced with standard pesticides are hazardous residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest resurgence (Lewis, 1997 ). The use of natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more eco-friendly are encouraged and synthetic pesticides should just be used as a last resort or only utilized as required and typically just at particular times in a pests life cycle.</p>
<p>It is a proactive technique to handling pests," states Dr. Siddiqi, and utilizes chemicals just as a last resort. Lots of pest control workers begin as assistants and acquire on-the-job training. Hives and Nests: When you can see hives and nests in and around your house, it indicates that there are a lot of pests doing their grunt work. The main method is to promote beneficial insects that consume or parasitize target pests.</p>
