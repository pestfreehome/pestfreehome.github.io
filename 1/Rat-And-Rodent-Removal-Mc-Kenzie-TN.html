<p>Some likewise recognized that if regionally coordinated IPM could take place, even yearly management of a constant pest might be made more effective (Faust and Chandler, 1998).

ABBA House Care clients experience pest free living frequently without any pesticides used inside. Pests develop resistance to biopesticides simply as they develop resistance to chemical pesticides.
