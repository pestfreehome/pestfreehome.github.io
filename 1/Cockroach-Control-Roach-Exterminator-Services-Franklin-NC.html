<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides utilized in a natural system are as damaging to people and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control experts can only do so much to secure the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The truth is, food business operators have to take an active function in integrated pest management by working carefully with the specialists.</p>
<p>A particular pest can be managed by particular alternatives, but they may not all be available in a specific place, for a specific crop, or within the available monetary ways. IPM includes using the best combination of cultural, biological and chemical procedures for particular situations, including plant biotechnology as appropriate. This planning consists of attention to field histories to expect what the pest problems might be, choosing crop varieties which are resistant or tolerant to pest damage, selecting tillage systems that will suppress anticipated pest damage while providing the crop the best yield capacity.</p>
<p>The success of control tactics must be measured using signs based on tracking of hazardous organisms, beneficials, pesticide usage, and impact on the environment. These include the renewal of pest populations after decimation of the natural opponents, development of insecticide-resistant populations, and negative influence on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
<p>It keeps using pesticide and other interventions to levels that are economically and ecologically justified and minimises threats to human health and the environment. In a metaanalysis of data of 145 studies, the effectiveness of either parasitoids or predators was shown to be great in reducing the variety of pests and increasing pest death (Stiling and Cornelissen, 2005).</p>
