<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the best for other organisms and for soil, air, and water quality; use pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds instead of a whole location. Due to any number of factors, including those pointed out in the Chemical and Cultural areas, compromising the efficiency of natural enemies frequently enables prospective pest organisms to experience practically uncontrolled population growth and allows them to reach pest status.</p>

If a number of the pests are eliminated, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides need to be used as the last option, in concept, sometimes they are the very first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of particular endemic or intrusive pests and illness or to secure the seed and transplants from common and persistent pest issues.</p>
