<p>For some tasks, pest control employees use a mix of pest management strategies, a practice called integrated pest management. The foundation of an effective IPM program is a schedule of routine assessments. Crop losses due to illness, weeds, and arthropods, though disputed by some as a legitimate measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the surge of pest control.</p>
