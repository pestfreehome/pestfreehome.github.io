The majority of insecticides fall under the chemical category since they are generally more efficient and can typically be used to control numerous pests.

<p>We historically have actually sold nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the effectiveness of ecologically unsound methods along with its array of fundamental strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thereby increasing the possibility that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
