<p>Releases of natural opponents might be required throughout the growing season in order to sustain arthropod pests at low populations. Lowering the use of pesticides is likewise crucial as an increasing number of pests are establishing resistance to chemical pest control. Non target species like natural enemies of pest get impacted.
