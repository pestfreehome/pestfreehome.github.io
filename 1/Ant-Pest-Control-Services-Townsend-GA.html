<p>As part of the Sustainable Usage Directive on Pesticides, professional users of pesticides are required to consider the concepts of IPM before making use of chemicals. Biological pest control is a technique of controlling pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms 8 It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically likewise involves an active human management role.</p>
<p>The principle has been around because the 1920's when cotton pest management program was developed. Pest control companies know the ideal pesticide to utilize in any scenario, this saves a lot of expenses. Poisoning by direct exposure to pesticides may occur quickly after a single direct exposure (intense poisoning) or gradually after repeated exposures over a time period (persistent poisoning).</p>
