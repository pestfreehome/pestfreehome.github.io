It is a term that describes the way in which growers cultivate and secure their crops based on an understanding of cycles in and around plants, of stabilities and relationships of reliance between plants, insects, micro-organisms and nutrients.</p>
<p>The number of plants inspected will depend upon aspects such as the value of the crop, potential issues and size and kind of greenhouses. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combines different types of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to conventional synthetic pesticides-- in a practical, long-term strategy. Biopesticides are usually compatible with natural enemies, however there are exceptions.</p>
