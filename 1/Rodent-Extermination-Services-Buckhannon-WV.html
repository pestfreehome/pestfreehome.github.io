These studies conclude that IPM techniques are yield efficient, environmentally friendly, and can be the foundation of sustainable cropping systems ( Hall et al., 2013 ). An over-reliance on pesticides has proven to be unsustainable, less cost effective, and less efficient for pest control ( Berg and Tam, 2012 ; Rasmussen et al., 2012 ; Alam, 2013 ; Rodrigo et al., 2013 ).">
