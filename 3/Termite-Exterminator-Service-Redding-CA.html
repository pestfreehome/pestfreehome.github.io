<p>Hey, I'm Ashley (Branding Professional) and I'm going to guide you through our four steps to name your pest control business. A pest control employee is sometimes described as an exterminator. A single spotting of any pest in a warehouse during an audit can mean a lot of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise.

After handling numerous nationwide chain exterminators and being mostly disappointed with the service, I relied on Terminators for assist with pest problems at my business. The concept of IPM is to keep an eye on and control pests only when they begin appearing and eliminating the over application of pesticides in the living environmentWe are well versed with IPM strategies, Scope of works, application approaches and industry specific record keeping procedures.</p>

Examples include cultivation of alternate hosts (e.g., weeds), crop rotation, choice of planting sites, trap crops, and adjusting the timing of planting or harvest.</p>
