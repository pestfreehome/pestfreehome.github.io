<p>Well-informed field teams will be able to determine and monitor pest problems and effectively execute the management techniques. The concept of integrated pest management (IPM) stemmed practically 60 years earlier in action to these unfavorable impacts of pesticides. Numerous of the resources listed at the end of this leaflet can be used for identification of insect pests impacting collections.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family pest pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being practically specifically about minimizing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management techniques are not able to keep an insect pest population below an economic threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>Generally, the main aim of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, originally established for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now developed to incorporate illness, weeds, and other pests that may interfere with the management objectives of sites such as residential and commercial structures, lawn and turf areas, and house and community gardens.</p>
