<p>These might or may not consist of materials listed on the Organic Materials Evaluation Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and especially insecticides utilized in natural farming and natural gardening are generally safer than artificial pesticides, they are not always more safe or eco-friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause damage.</p>

Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about reducing pesticide use.
