<p>For some jobs, pest control employees utilize a mix of pest management techniques, a practice known as integrated pest management. The cornerstone of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of regular examinations. Crop losses due to arthropods, illness, and weeds, though challenged by some as a valid measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the augmentation of pest control.</p>
<p>4 ). With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is deemed a environmentally benign and economical  pest control method preferably matched for both small and large farmers all over the world. When termites have gone into a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some methods, IPM can be deemed a decision-making process in which observations (from inspection and tracking) are utilized to make pest control decisions based upon pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a procedure that is used to control pest populations while minimizing the impacts on people and the surrounding environment. Though there is a debate of using chemicals due to ecological pollution it is a reality that this is the only approach which is widely accepted and gave reliable control of pest.</p>
