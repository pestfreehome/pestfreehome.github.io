<p>The lots of differing threats from pests make it a good idea for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their structures and collections. In these nations, routine use of pesticides is restricted to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly centered on cotton, sugarcane, soybean, and rice.</p>
<p>Concurrently, it is likewise based on semiochemicals especially allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are warded off or hindered far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once drawn in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ). A lot of pesticide problems are caused by a small number of the pesticides offered today.</p>
