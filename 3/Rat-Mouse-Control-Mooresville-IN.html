<p>Action Pest Control offers detailed bed bug control services including assessments carried out by extremely trained bed bug pet dogs and bed bug heat treatments administered by expert bed bug specialists. With more policies on pesticide usage and a reduction in the variety of active ingredients in some crops, there is a higher emphasis on better understanding of offered control choices (Hillocks 2012 ).
