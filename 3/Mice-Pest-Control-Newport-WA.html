Modern crop ranges often unintentionally develop conditions which favor pest types (e.g., pest types which have bored deeper into larger fruit making them unattainable to natural enemies). Anticipate SARS-CoV-2 to act like an intrusive species presented to a new area when resources abound (that is, individuals without immunity) and there are no biological controls to keep the population in check or signed up products to utilize in management (such as federally approved medications).</p>
