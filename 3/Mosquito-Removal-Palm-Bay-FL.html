<p>WebMD veterinary experts response typically asked questions about fleas and ticks on your pet. Socio-psychological elements including logical and moral considerations were discovered to the drivers in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that a lack of certified IPM professionals and extension educators was an impediment for IPM implementation in developed nations.</p>
<p>When pest issues are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control steps are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry toxic substances in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>
