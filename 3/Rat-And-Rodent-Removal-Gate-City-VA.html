Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode ruin roots in the earth, snails, and larvae destroy berries and leaves originating from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>
<p>Insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other pest control and lawn care items are most efficient when they are used properly.
