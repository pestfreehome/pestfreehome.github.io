<p>More info is required about food-chain concentration and practical ways of getting rid of harmful effects of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have actually served their purpose. Don't base pest management programs on total elimination of a pest. Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode ruin roots in the earth, snails, and larvae destroy berries and leaves originating from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>
<p>Insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other pest control and lawn care items are most efficient when they are used properly.
