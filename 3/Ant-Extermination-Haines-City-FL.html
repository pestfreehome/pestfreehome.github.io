<p>The very best method to control pests is to make your house unattractive to them. However home pests can also be a threat to your family.

Biological control is much easier to implement in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (several crops).</p>
<p>Concurrently, it is likewise based upon semiochemicals particularly allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are warded off or prevented far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are concurrently drawn in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ). Most pesticide issues are brought on by a little number of the pesticides available today.</p>
