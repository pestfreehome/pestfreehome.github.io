<p>IPCA highly suggests working with certified and proficient pest control professionals from IPCA Member organisations throughout the nation. Agriculture deals with the problem with integrated pest management. The term pest" describes more than one cause of issues including diseases, undesirable insects, termites, mollusks, weeds and nematodes. A number of treatment methods have actually been utilized, including chemical approaches, such as pesticide applications and poisonous gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or warming the materials, the use of micro-waves, gamma radiation, customized atmospheres, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface area sprays and termite treatments, stick around in the environment for days, weeks or perhaps longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an important element of an incorporated pest management programme. But by concentrating on non-chemical options initially, you can make sure that your pest management program is effectively getting rid of pests at the least threat to your food safety program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses much of the very same ideas as IPM but limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to minimize the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
