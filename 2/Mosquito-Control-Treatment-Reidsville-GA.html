<h3>Pest Control Myths Reidsville GA</h3>
<p>Although numerous sources define IPM in different ways, previous models primarily focused on the environmental, and to some level on the evolutionary, elements of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A current IPM pyramid provided by Stenberg (2017) recognized a lack of a holistic IPM method that utilizes both modern-day and standard tools.</p>
<p>Monitoring means inspecting your field, structure, landscape, or forest-- or other site-- to identify which pests exist, how many there are, or what damage they have actually caused.
