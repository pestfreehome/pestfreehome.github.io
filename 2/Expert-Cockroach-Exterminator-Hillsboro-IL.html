<p>The habits of the pest can be made use of for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and mating interruption methods (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). When distributed in the field or positioned in traps, baits consisting of dangerous product will draw in and kill the pests.</p>
<p>In referral to the idea of integrating making use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later broadened to welcome coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).
