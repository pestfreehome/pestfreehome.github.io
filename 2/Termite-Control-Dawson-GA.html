<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address invasive pest problems, classical biological control method is typically used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has been effectively utilized versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly achieve levels at which damage is triggered thus becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a wealthy neighborhood likely will have a lot of big, pricey homes, so pest control expenses might be greater there because there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in among those houses.</p>
