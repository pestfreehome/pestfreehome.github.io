The understanding of various control alternatives, pest biology and damage potential, and suitability of readily available resources enables the grower to decide appropriate for their situation. Greenhouses offer an appropriate environment (e.g., temperature level and light) for many biological control representatives or natural opponents consisting of parasitoids, predators, and entomopathogenic nematodes.</p>
<p>The variety of plants examined will depend on factors such as the worth of the crop, prospective issues and size and type of greenhouses. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) integrates various kinds of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to standard artificial pesticides-- in a practical, long-lasting strategy.

<p>Simultaneously, it is likewise based upon semiochemicals especially allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are repelled or discouraged away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are simultaneously brought in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ). Most pesticide problems are caused by a small number of the pesticides offered today.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses a lot of the exact same concepts as IPM however restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
