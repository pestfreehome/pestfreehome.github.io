<p>The red imported fire ant is a troublesome and well-known pest throughout the southeastern United States. Pest management requires a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied only after regular monitoring indicates that a pest population had reached a financial limit level. Many private product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to specify what IPM indicates for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are readily available in minimal areas.</p>

The goal is to offer a general understanding of the concepts of IPM, together with the concepts for application in all crops.
