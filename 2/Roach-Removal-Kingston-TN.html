<p>The red imported fire ant is a bothersome and popular pest throughout the southeastern United States. Pest management requires a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied only after regular monitoring indicates that a pest population had reached a financial limit level. Many private product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM means for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in limited locations.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived toxic metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, comparable to synthetic chemicals, and possess many of the environmental and human safety risks as chemical pesticides.</p>
