<p>They are chosen and used in a method that avoids interfering with other IPM practices if pesticides are required.

Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
<p>Pest control is a very essential measure owing to the truth that a number of pests are carriers of harmful disease-causing microbes.

While pheromones are absolutely nothing brand-new to pest control-- pest control experts regularly utilize scents traps as a way to keep an eye on pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a brand-new idea.</p>
