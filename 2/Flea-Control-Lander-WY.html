<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived poisonous metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical molecules, similar to artificial chemicals, and possess many of the environmental and human security dangers as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>The seriousness and incidence of numerous plant diseases can also be decreased by crop rotation, and selection of the planting site may affect the seriousness of insect invasions.
