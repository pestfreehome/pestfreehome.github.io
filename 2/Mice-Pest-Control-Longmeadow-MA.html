<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your house unappealing to them. However home pests can likewise be a risk to your household. When looking for a place to infest, pests prefer to hide in a place that provides food and a safe breeding place.

To lessen potential damage to advantageous insects, restrict your spraying to small locations where you can see pests lurking, and leave a couple of unsprayed "havens" for any excellent bugs you can't see.</p>
