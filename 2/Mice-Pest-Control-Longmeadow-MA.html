<p>These unknown or inadequately comprehended possible dangers argue for additional levels of defense including exposures to multiple pesticides, in the house, at school and in the diet; direct exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, commercial compounds and personal care products; and the general difficulty in attributing chronic health problems to any one particular cause.</p>
<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your house unappealing to them. However home pests can likewise be a risk to your household. When looking for a place to infest, pests prefer to hide in a place that provides food and a safe breeding place.

To lessen potential damage to advantageous insects, restrict your spraying to small locations where you can see pests lurking, and leave a couple of unsprayed "havens" for any excellent bugs you can't see.</p>
