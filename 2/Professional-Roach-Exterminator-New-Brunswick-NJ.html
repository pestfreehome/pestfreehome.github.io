<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived poisonous metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical molecules, comparable to artificial chemicals, and have much of the human and environmental safety dangers as chemical pesticides.</p>
