<p>The four significant issues come across with standard pesticides are hazardous residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest revival (Lewis, 1997 ). Using natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more eco-friendly are synthetic and encouraged pesticides should only be used as a last hope or only used as needed and often only at specific times in a pests life cycle.</p>
<p>These unidentified or inadequately understood possible hazards argue for additional levels of protection including exposures to numerous pesticides, at home, at school and in the diet plan; direct exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, commercial substances and individual care items; and the general difficulty in attributing persistent illnesses to any one particular cause.</p>
<p>The benefits of Integrated Pest Management are tremendous straight to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control includes the use of living organisms to control a pest population. Do not mix pesticides. There are four major elements in the new IPM model that resolve numerous pest management options, the knowledge, and resources the grower needs to resolve the pest issue, preparation and organization of information to take proper management actions, and keeping good interaction to disseminate and obtain understanding about pests and their management.</p>
<p>Environmentally safe: Lots of biological control representatives are ecological professionals. Standards and legislation concerning the usage, allowed methods of application and the storage conditions of chemicals and pesticides vary from nation to nation, frequently being legislated by each state of territory. Research study and outreach are an essential part of the IPM model to expect and determine pest problems, develop preventive and alleviative techniques, and successfully share the details through conventional and contemporary interaction tools and methods.</p>
