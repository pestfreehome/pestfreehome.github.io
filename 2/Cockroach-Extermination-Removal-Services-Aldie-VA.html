	<meta name="description" content="Pest Control Bees in Aldie VA - Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal dosages of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience retarded development and feeding and are subject to higher parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae ( 40 ). In other words, an effective, nondisruptive way to manage a moderate beet armyworm outbreak may be to retard its development and damage while giving the parasitoids time to work, thereby strengthening the parasitoids' effect during subsequent generations.">
